    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python OOP?\n",
    "ANS=In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming.\n",
    " It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. \n",
